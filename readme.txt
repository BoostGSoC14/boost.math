This is a partial Boost.Math area for:

* Generalized hypergeometric functions
* This work is under construction for the 2014 Google Summer of Code

Project details
--------------------------------------------------------

This project is intended to add several new files to the existing
file structure of Boost.Math. These new files contain implementations
of generalized hypergeometric functions in different parameter ranges.

This project has a strong research character. The effort of finding
practical methods for computating hypergeometric functions is just
as large (or larger) than the resulting implementations in code.

Upon successful completion of this project, some or all of the
candidate files in this project may potentially be merged to and/or
included in Boost.Math.

The computational methods found should be documented.

--------------------------------------------------------
Using this project with Boost
--------------------------------------------------------

The files in this project can be used with an existing Boost
installation or with a development copy of modular-boost.

The way to use these files with an existing Boost installation
or modular-boost is to include the base directory of this project
in the normal "C++ way". The added include path of this project
should be placed *before* the include path of the Boost installation
or modular-boost.
